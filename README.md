## ðŸ§±â€…Â·â€…Local Build
- [Install nix].
- Check out the [Setup with binary cache] section, at [usertam/context-minimals].
- Change to branch, then do `nix build`.

## ðŸ”©â€…Â·â€…Develop
This checks out all branches as worktrees locally.
```sh
git clone git@github.com:csess/publications.git && cd publications
git for-each-ref --format="%(refname:lstrip=3)" refs/remotes/origin | \
  grep -Ev 'HEAD|master|dist' | xargs -i git worktree add {} {}
```
This forks and checks out a new branch from the template branch.
```sh
git branch -c templates/context 2023/<new-branch>
git worktree add 2023/<new-directory> 2023/<new-branch> # at repo root
```
